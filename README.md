# Geomagnetic indices


## About

### ASY-D, ASY-H, SYM-D, SYM-H 

To describe the geomagnetic disturbances at mid-latitudes in terms of longitudinally 
asymmetric (ASY) and symmetric (SYM) disturbances for both H and D components 
respectively parallel and perpendicular to the dipole axis.
SYM-H is essentially the same as the Dst index with a different time resolution.

### Dst index

Dst (Disturbance Storm Time) equivalent equatorial magnetic disturbance indices 
are derived from hourly scalings of low-latitude horizontal magnetic variation.  

Dst index is an index of magnetic activity derived from a network of near-equatorial 
geomagnetic observatories that measures the intensity of the globally symmetrical equatorial 
electrojet (the "ring current"). Dst is maintained at NGDC and is available via FTP 
from 1957 to the present.

### Kp Index

The K-index, and by extension the Planetary K-index, are used to characterize the 
magnitude of geomagnetic storms. Kp is an excellent indicator of disturbances in 
the Earth's magnetic field and is used by SWPC to decide whether geomagnetic 
alerts and warnings need to be issued for users who are affected by these disturbances.

The principal users affected by geomagnetic storms are the electrical power grid,
 spacecraft operations, users of radio signals that reflect off of or pass 
 through the ionosphere, and observers of the aurora.


The K-index quantifies disturbances in the horizontal component of earth's 
magnetic field with an integer in the range 0-9 with 1 being calm and 5 or 
more indicating a geomagnetic storm. It is derived from the maximum fluctuations 
of horizontal components observed on a magnetometer during a three-hour interval. 
The planetary 3-hour-range index Kp is the mean standardized K-index from 
13 geomagnetic observatories between 44 degrees and 60 degrees northern or southern 
geomagnetic latitude. The label 'K' comes from the German word 'Kennziffer' meaning 
'characteristic digit.'
